//According to Wikipedia's article: "The Game of Life, also known simply as 
//Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton 
//Conway in 1970." 
//
// The board is made up of an m x n grid of cells, where each cell has an 
//initial state: live (represented by a 1) or dead (represented by a 0). Each cell 
//interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the 
//following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article): 
//
// 
// Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-
//population. 
// Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next 
//generation. 
// Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-
//population. 
// Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if 
//by reproduction. 
// 
//
// The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to 
//every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously. Given 
//the current state of the m x n grid board, return the next state. 
//
// 
// Example 1: 
//
// 
//Input: board = [[0,1,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[0,0,0]]
//Output: [[0,0,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,1,0]]
// 
//
// Example 2: 
//
// 
//Input: board = [[1,1],[1,0]]
//Output: [[1,1],[1,1]]
// 
//
// 
// Constraints: 
//
// 
// m == board.length 
// n == board[i].length 
// 1 <= m, n <= 25 
// board[i][j] is 0 or 1. 
// 
//
// 
// Follow up: 
//
// 
// Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated 
//simultaneously: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated 
//values to update other cells. 
// In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the 
//board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches 
//upon the border of the array (i.e., live cells reach the border). How would you 
//address these problems?
